The home range used by one group of gorillas during one year is influenced by availability of food sources and usually includes several vegetation zones. George Schaller identified ten distinct zones, including: bamboo forest at 2,200–2,800 m (7,200–9,200 ft); Hagenia forest at 2,800–3,400 m (9,200–11,200 ft); and the giant senecio zone at 3,400–4,300 m (11,200–14,100 ft).[15] The mountain gorilla spends most of its time in Hagenia forest, where galium vines are found year-round. All parts of this vine are consumed: leaves, stems, flowers, and berries. It travels to the bamboo forest during the few months of the year when fresh shoots are available, and it climbs into subalpine regions to eat the soft centers of giant senecio trees.
