The mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) is one of the two subspecies of the eastern gorilla. It is listed as endangered by the IUCN as of 2018.[2]

There are two populations: One lives in the Virunga Mountains in Mgahinga in southwestern Uganda, Volcanoes in northwestern Rwanda and Virunga National Park in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The other population lives in Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Some primatologists speculate the Bwindi population is a separate subspecies.[3] As of 2019, there are an estimated 1,063 mountain gorillas in the world.
