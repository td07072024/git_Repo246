The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forest, including the Virunga Mountains, ranging in elevation from 2,200 to 4,300 m (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Most groups live on the slopes of three of the dormant volcanoes: Karisimbi, Mikeno, and Visoke.[16] The vegetation is very dense at the bottom of the mountains, becoming more sparse at higher elevations, and the forests are often cloudy, misty and cold.[17] The mountain gorilla also occasionally uses the border habitat with the Rwenzori-Virunga montane moorlands, at elevations higher than the Albertine Rift montane cloud forest.
