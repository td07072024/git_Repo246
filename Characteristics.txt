The fur of the mountain gorilla, often thicker and longer than that of other gorilla species, enables them to live in colder temperatures.[8] Gorillas can be identified by nose prints unique to each individual[9]

Males reach a standing height of 1.61–1.71 m (5.3–5.6 ft), a girth of 1.38–1.63 m (4.5–5.3 ft), an arm span of 2 to 2.7 m (6.6 to 8.9 ft) and a weight of 120–191 kg (265–421 lb). Females are smaller with a weight of 70–98 kg (154–216 lb).[10] This subspecies is smaller than the eastern lowland gorilla, the other subspecies of eastern gorilla. Adult males have more pronounced bony crests on the top and back of their skulls, giving their heads a more conical shape. These crests anchor the powerful temporalis muscles, which attach to the lower jaw (mandible). Adult females also have these crests, but they are less pronounced.[11] Like all gorillas, they feature dark brown eyes framed by a black ring around the iris. Adult males are called silverbacks because a saddle of gray or silver-colored hair develops on their backs with age. The hair on their backs is shorter than on most other body parts, and their arm hair is especially long. Fully erect males average 1.7 m (5.6 ft) in height, with an arm span of 2.3 m (7.5 ft) and weigh 155 kg (342 lb).[12] The tallest silverback recorded was 1.95 m (6.4 ft) tall with an arm span of 2.7 m (8.9 ft), a chest of 1.98 m (6.5 ft), and a weight of 219 kg (483 lb), shot in Alimbongo, northern Kivu in May 1938. There is an unconfirmed record of another individual, shot in 1932, that was 2.06 m (6.8 ft) and weighed 218.6 kg (482 lb). The heaviest silverback to ever live in captivity was a gorilla named N'gagi, a gorilla at the San Diego Zoo who died in 1944. His heaviest weight in life was 683 lb (310 kg), but at the time of his death, he was 636 lb (288 kg).[13]

The mountain gorilla is primarily terrestrial and quadrupedal. However, it will climb into fruiting trees if the branches can carry its weight. Like all great apes other than humans, its arms are longer than its legs. It moves by knuckle-walking, supporting its weight on the backs of its curved fingers rather than its palms.[14]

The mountain gorilla is diurnal, spending most of the day eating, as large quantities of food are needed to sustain its massive bulk. It forages in the early morning, rests during the late morning and around midday, and in the afternoon it forages again before resting at night. Each gorilla builds a nest from surrounding vegetation to sleep in, constructing a new one every evening. Only infants sleep in the same nest as their mothers. They leave their sleeping sites when the sun rises at around 6 am, except when it is cold and overcast; then they often stay longer in their nests.
